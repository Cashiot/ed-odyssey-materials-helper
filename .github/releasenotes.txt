**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb file

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Added a new shipbuilder tab with some cool features
- Create a wishlist from your shipbuild
- See your current ingame shipbuild
- Live tracking of your ship configuration (cargo, pips, fuel), available for your current ingame ship only
- See weapon and utility slot placement visually
- Create weapon groups to see group statistics
- Easy switching between module size and class while maintaining engineering
- Easily save legacy modules for reuse or create Legacy modules under Settings
- Automatic resizing of modules when moving between slots
Added a loading screen at the start of the application
Added option to import shared wishlist/ship/loadout through Settings or CTRL+V

It has been over a year of hard work and several months of beta testing. The feature might not be perfect yet, but it's time to release it to the public. Please report any issues you find, so we can improve it further.

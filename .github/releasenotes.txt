**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb file

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Upgrade to java 22.0.1
Added digital signing to MSI installer (hopefully to reduce AV false positives)
Automatic uplaod to virustotal on release (hopefully to reduce AV false positives)

Fixed shipbuilder UI getting stuck when equipping Guardian Plasma Charger (or any other weapon without precalculated DPS)
Added Ray Gateway material trader
Added configuration option to select the screen for displaying notifications
